# Overview of the analysis: 
  This project is about helping PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app company, improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Through exploratory analysis and data visualization techniques, we establish  
  * Relationships between the Types of City and the Number of Drivers/Riders 
  * Percentage of Total Fares/Drivers/Riders based on City Type.

# Results: 
  After diving deep into the data to identify relationships, here's a summary of the analysis which clearly depicts the contribution of each City Type to Pyber's revenue and highlights the ones with the most potential.

  It is obvious that Urban City Types have yielded close to 40 grand USD, the most revenue for Pyber. But we shouldn't turn a blind eye to the potential Rural and Suburban City Types hold for us. On an average a Rural driver makes $55 which is 69% more than what an Urban driver makes. Similarly, a Suburban driver makes 58% more than an Urban driver. 
  
 We should also note that these "previledged" Rural and Suburban drivers account only for 0.8% and 12.8% of the total drivers in PyBer. There is no evidence yet to assess the supply and demand of drivers in these areas but ,it would be smart to deploy more drivers to these neighborhoods on experimental basis, whiile constantly monitoring the increase in total rides and revenue generated by these neighborhoods.

  There is also another interesting angle to this whole scenario. Urban cities are more thickly populated, leading to the distance between any two destinations prone to be a lot lesser than the suburban or rural neighborhoods. Eventually these shorter rides could account for the Urban cities to generate lesser revenue per ride/driver despite the higher number of rides compared to its Suburban and Rural counterparts.

# Summary: 
  Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
