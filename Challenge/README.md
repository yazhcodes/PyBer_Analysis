# OVERVIEW 
  This project is about helping PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app company, improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Through exploratory analysis and data visualization techniques, we establish  
  * Relationships between the Types of City and the Number of Drivers/Riders 
  * Percentage of Total Fares/Drivers/Riders based on City Type.

# RESULTS 
  After diving deep into the data to identify relationships, here's a summary of the analysis which clearly depicts the contribution of each City Type to Pyber's revenue and highlights the ones with the most potential.

## Unleash the Hidden Dragon
   While it is obvious that Urban City Types have yielded close to 40 grand USD, the most revenue for Pyber, we shouldn't turn a blind eye to the potential Rural and Suburban City Types hold for us. On an average a Rural driver makes $55 which is 69% more than what an Urban driver makes. Similarly, a Suburban driver makes 58% more than an Urban driver. 
  
   We should also note that these "previledged" Rural and Suburban drivers account only for 0.8% and 12.8% of the total drivers in PyBer. There is no evidence yet to assess the supply and demand of drivers in these areas but, it would be smart to deploy more drivers to these neighborhoods on experimental basis, while constantly monitoring the increase in total rides and revenue generated by these neighborhoods.

## Let's not ignore the Ride Lengths
  There is also another interesting angle to this whole scenario. Urban cities are more **thickly populated**, resulting in the distance between a given pick up and drop off location to be a lot lesser than those in the suburban or rural neighborhoods. Eventually these **shorter rides** could account for the Urban cities to generate **lesser revenue per ride/driver despite the higher number of rides** compared to its Suburban and Rural counterparts.
  
##  Protect The Golden Egg
  All said and done, we cannot overlook the fact that the total fares yielded by Urban cities is multiple times more than that of the other city types. While we work towards providing better services to Suburban and Rural areas, it is also crucial to ensure that the current services rendered to Urban areas are continued, if not improved, to keep the revenue flowing in.

# SUMMARY 
  Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
